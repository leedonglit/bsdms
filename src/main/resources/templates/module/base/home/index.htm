            <p>The construction goal of this system is to ensure that the data collected and generated during the entire process of the experiment is immutable, recorded, traceable, and can intuitively understand and control the progress of the experiment, supervise the data during the experiment process, and achieve academic results in experimental management and data storage after promotion and use in the field, all of which have high credibility in the industry. It was originally developed and now maintained by Dr. Dawei Lu, Dr. Lee.</p>

            <p>You can first register as a ‘BSDMS’ user, then refer to the functional instructions in the’ Tutorial ‘, or contact us for relevant content. One of the important usage mechanisms of this system is to address the unchangeable and non overwritten data that has already been entered.</p>
            <p>Using blockchain ideas and technology, design and implement data that has already benn entered by various experimental roles in this system, and no one can return and modify it again.</p>
